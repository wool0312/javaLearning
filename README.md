I just want to place some useful resources of Java learing, which will be convenient for me to review and maybe help others.

# the Fist Record
I upload a practice in Java MOOC of University of Helsinki located in Programming 1 part 4 section 3. It uses OOP to analyze statistics files, both of which worth learning.
On the one hand, I should transfer my mind to solve prolems in object perspective, including the objects usage in list. On the other hand, I can encapsulate the process of reading file to make the program more understandable.
